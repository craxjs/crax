## ⚙️ Contributing

Work in progress, more of a weekend project, raised due to frustration with Next Js heaviness when developing and slow reloads and yeah the feeling that it's too much overhead, so hit the issues tab and say something or make a PR, all good. No much rules so long as nothing destroys the simplicity!
